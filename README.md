Overview
The Automatic Signature Verification and Detection System (ASVDS) is a machine learning-based application designed to verify and detect the authenticity of handwritten signatures. This system helps in fraud prevention, document verification, and identity authentication by analyzing and comparing signatures against pre-registered samples.
Features
✅ Signature Verification – Compares input signatures with stored samples and determines authenticity.
✅ Forgery Detection – Detects possible forged or fraudulent signatures using advanced algorithms.
✅ Machine Learning Integration – Utilizes deep learning models for signature pattern recognition.
✅ Preprocessing Techniques – Image enhancement, noise reduction, and feature extraction.
✅ User Interface – A simple and interactive UI for uploading and verifying signatures.
✅ Database Storage – Stores signature samples for future verification.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
User Interface: Tkinter/Flask (Optional Web App)
Database: SQLite/MySQL (For storing user signatures)

How It Works
Image Preprocessing: The input signature image is cleaned, resized, and converted into grayscale.
Feature Extraction: Key signature features such as edges, contours, and patterns are extracted.
Model Training: A machine learning/deep learning model is trained using a dataset of genuine and forged signatures.
Signature Matching: The system compares the input signature with stored samples and classifies it as authentic or forged.
Result Display: The system provides a confidence score and decision on authenticity.
